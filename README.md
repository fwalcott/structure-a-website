<h1>The Four Most Important Thing I Learned About Structuring A Web Page.</h1>
<br> 
<br>

<ul><strong> Site Map </strong><ul>
<li> A site map is critical to a multi-page website.</li> 
  <li> It helps you visualize the entire make up of the site. </li>
  <li> Shows you what links go where and helps you set up your site in a logical yet intuitive way.</li>  
</ul>
<br>

<p> <a href="http://karlcleveland.com/125/sitemaps.htm" target="blank">Here are examples of a site map </a> </p>
<br> 
<br>
<ul> <strong> Wire Frame </strong> </ul>
<li>A wire frame helps you set up how you want to set up the layout of your website's content.</li> 
<li>It is a visual to help you plan out where you want things to go. </li> 
<li>It is like a sketch you can makeusing a pen and paper, a drawing app such as MS Paint or Photoshop, or online wireframe tools such as <a href="https://gomockingbird.com/home" target="blank">Go Mocking Bird </a> or <a href="https://lovelycharts.com/" target="blank">Lovely Charts. </a> 
</li> 
</ul>
<br> 
<br>
<ul> <strong> hgroup </strong> </ul>
<li> hgroup is a grouping together of one or more h1 to h6 (headings h1 the largest and h6 the smallest) so that they are treated as one heading.</li> 
<br>

<p> <strong>Example of an hgroup </strong> </p> 
<br> 

<hgroup>
<h2>Food Blogs</h2>
<h3>These Are The Best Food Blogger For The Beginner Home Cook</h3>
</hgroup> 
<br>
<p>This hgroup contains both a title which is an h2 element and a subtitle with and h3 element. </p> 
<br> 
<br>

<ul> <strong> Metadata </strong> </ul>
<li>Metadata is crucial. </li> 
<li>It lives inside the head element and contains information about the web page, and It is not visible to users.</li>
<li> It tells search engines information about your page.</li> 
<li> The most important parts are the description (tells search engines what the page is about and the keyword (contains a list separated by commas that a user might search for).</li> 
  <li> Keywords help people find your site. </li> 
  </ul>
